Lokey is Local KEY


Introduction 

	Lokey is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or a DAO that is run using blockchain technology. Unlike traditional organizations, which are typically controlled by a central authority, Lokey is decentralized and operates according to a set of rules encoded in its smart contracts. These rules are typically designed to be transparent and immutable, allowing the Lokey network to operate in a transparent and secure manner. Because of the decentralized nature of a distributed ledger technology, decisions are often made through consensus among its members, rather than being dictated by a single individual or group.
	KEY is the governance token of Lokey. Governance tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that represents ownership in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). These tokens give their holders the right to vote on how the DAO is run and on any proposals for changes to its underlying code. The exact mechanics of how governance tokens work can vary depending on the specific DAO, but in general, they allow token holders to have a say in the direction of the organization and its decision-making process. Some governance tokens also give holders the ability to earn rewards for participating in the DAO's governance, such as by voting on proposals or contributing to the DAO's development.
	The city first creates  the necessary digital tokens to serve as the currency through a process called minting. Once completed, the city can promote the use of the cryptocurrency among its residents and businesses. This can be done through marketing campaigns and partnerships with local organizations. The city then elects and establishes rules and regulations for the use of the cryptocurrency, as well as develop a plan for managing the allocation of tokens. 
	City tokens are allocated pro rata for the amount of value staked for a given city. Each minted city receives a unique token name and a digital image representing the token. City tokens compete in value with other cities on the network. 



Decentralized Value Transfer

	The traditional financial system is built on a system of trust. When a company issues stock, it creates stock certificates that serve as proof of ownership. These certificates typically include the company's name, the number of shares owned by the shareholder, and the shareholder's name. The ownership of the stock is recorded in the shareholder's name on the company's books.
	There is no way to verify that I own a stock in a brokerage account other than trust that they hold the asset. Robinhood is an example of a brokerage that claimed to have ownership of stock certificates but in fact did not. A stock’s certificate is generally held in electronic form commonly called street name. The DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation) is the financial services company that owns every stock certificate issued. This central organization provides clearing and settlement services for financial transactions. It acts as a central clearinghouse for transactions involving stocks, bonds, and other securities. The asset itself is owned by this third party entity, there only exists perceived ownership by the end user. Trusting any centralized entity for finality of state change is a substancial attack vector that can be easily exploited, especially if the value is large enough. Lokey utilizes a decentralized network to minimize central points of failure and maximize security. 

Decentralized Voting

	Lokey network allocates resources based on decentralized voting. Decentralized voting is a way of conducting elections in which the administration of the vote is distributed among multiple individuals or entities rather than being centralized in a single body. This can be accomplished through the use of blockchain technology, which allows for secure and transparent record-keeping. In a decentralized voting system, each voter has a unique digital identity and votes are recorded on the blockchain in a way that ensures their security and anonymity. This allows for a more secure and transparent election process, as the decentralized nature of the system makes it difficult for any one person or entity to manipulate the vote.
	Proxy voting is a system that allows a person to appoint another person to cast a vote on their behalf. This type of voting is used when a shareholder of a company is unable to attend a shareholder meeting in person, but still wants to have their vote counted. In such cases, the shareholder can give a proxy, or a written authorization, to another person to attend the meeting and cast their vote. The proxy may be a trusted friend or associate of the shareholder, or it may be a representative of the company.
	By using blockchain technology, voting can be achieved in a trustless manner without the need for multiple layers of middlemen. Lokey network allows for verified proof of voting with permanent receipts stored to a blockchain. This verified voting model is an improvement to the methods commonly used in traditional finance. 
	Blockchain technology can be used to transfer assets from one party to another in a secure and transparent way. This is done by creating a digital record of the transfer on the blockchain, which is then verified and confirmed by the network of computers running the blockchain. This ensures that the transfer is secure and cannot be tampered with. The transferred assets can be anything of value, such as cryptocurrency, property deeds, or even voting rights.
	Lokey is a distributed ledger for voting. A distributed ledger is a type of database that is shared, replicated, and synchronized among multiple sites, institutions, or geographies. It allows transactions to be recorded and verified digitally and in a decentralized manner, without the need for a central authority or intermediary. The most well-known example of a distributed ledger is the blockchain, which is the technology underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
	Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure financial transactions and control the creation of new units. It was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, and it has since become the world's most widely used cryptocurrency. Because it is decentralized, it is not controlled by any government or financial institution, and its value is determined by supply and demand on exchanges.
	Bitcoin solved the double spend problem. The double spend problem is a potential issue with digital currencies where a single digital token can be spent multiple times. This is possible because digital tokens are simply data, so they can be duplicated or copied. The double spend problem can be addressed through the use of a centralized authority or a decentralized network that keeps track of transactions to ensure that each token is only spent once. One Bitcoin is always one Bitcoin. The validity of Bitcoin can be verified at any time by anyone with a connection to the network. There is only a fixed number of Bitcoin, which give it value as a scarce asset. The same cannot be said for fiat currencies which the amount circulating supply is unknown and not easily audited. 
	Solving the double spend problem lead to digital scarcity. Digital scarcity refers to the limited availability of digital goods or resources, such as virtual currencies or unique digital items in video games. This limited availability is typically created by design, with the goal of making the digital goods or resources valuable or desirable to users.


Non Fungible Tokens 

	NFTs represent the future of finance. A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of digital asset that is unique and cannot be replaced or exchanged for another asset on a one-to-one basis. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are fungible and can be easily exchanged for other units of the same cryptocurrency. NFTs are often used to represent unique items or experiences in online games, virtual worlds, and other digital platforms. Some examples of NFTs include unique virtual collectibles, unique in-game items, and unique digital artworks.
	Digital assets are electronic representations of value that can be bought, sold, or transferred over the internet. These assets can be either tangible, like cryptocurrencies, or intangible, like digital contracts or intellectual property. The key characteristic of digital assets is that they exist in digital form and can be easily transferred and stored on electronic devices, such as computers and smartphones.

Deeds as NFTs

	Certificates of ownership, like deeds to property, can be converted to a 1 of 1 digital asset. To put a deed on the blockchain, you first need to create a digital copy of the deed. This can be done by scanning the physical deed and saving it as a digital document, such as a PDF. Once you have a digital copy of the deed, you can use a blockchain platform to create a digital record of the deed on the blockchain. This will typically involve creating a new transaction on the blockchain that includes the digital copy of the deed as well as any relevant information about the deed, such as the parties involved and the date the deed was created. The transaction will then be added to the blockchain, creating a permanent and tamper-evident record of the deed. This is achieved through a conversion mechanism known as hashing. The hash of the unique certificate then can exist on the blockchain. Once the digital certificate is minted, the token representing its ownership can be sold by the owner for value. 

Ethereum and Smart Contracts

	Ethereum, like it’s predicesor Bitcoin is a type of distributed ledger. Ethereum innovated on Bitcoin’s original value proposition, adding something called smart contracts. 
	A smart contract is a digital program that can be used to automatically execute the terms of a contract when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts can be used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. They can be used in many different industries and for many different purposes, such as automating the transfer of assets or data between parties, simplifying the process of buying and selling goods or services, or enabling the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) on a blockchain. Smart contracts can help to reduce the need for intermediaries, increase the efficiency and transparency of transactions, and reduce the risk of fraud or tampering.
	A virtual machine (VM) is a software program that emulates the functionality of a physical computer. It allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical host machine, each in its own isolated environment.
	When a virtual machine is running, it behaves like a physical computer, executing instructions and accessing hardware resources as needed. However, the virtual machine's access to the host machine's hardware is controlled by the virtualization software, which ensures that each virtual machine is isolated from the others and can only access the resources that have been allocated to it.
	This allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, each in its own virtual environment, without interference or conflicts between them. It also allows users to run different versions of the same operating system, or to test software in different operating environments without the need for multiple physical machines.
	The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a virtual machine that allows for the execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM is designed to be a decentralized, globally accessible computing resource that can be used by anyone who has an internet connection.
	Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between the parties being written into the code of the contract. When a contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, it is executed by the EVM.
	The EVM is a stack-based machine, which means that it uses a pushdown stack to store data and instructions. When a contract is executed, it is first compiled into bytecode, which is a low-level, machine-readable language that the EVM can understand and execute.
	Once the contract is compiled into bytecode, it is sent to the EVM for execution. The EVM then processes the bytecode by executing the instructions it contains one by one. As the instructions are executed, the EVM uses the stack to store and manipulate data.
	The EVM is designed to be a secure and reliable environment for executing smart contracts. It uses a variety of techniques to prevent fraud and ensure the integrity of the data and code that is executed on the platform.
	One of the key features of the EVM is that it is isolated from the rest of the Ethereum network. This means that when a contract is executed, it runs in a separate, protected environment that is isolated from the rest of the network. This helps to prevent malicious actors from interfering with the execution of the contract or accessing sensitive data. Overall, the Ethereum Virtual Machine is a crucial part of the Ethereum blockchain, as it allows for the execution of smart contracts and other decentralized applications. Ethereum gas is a unit of measure that is used to determine the amount of computational effort that is required to execute a particular operation or transaction on the Ethereum network. Every operation on the Ethereum network, such as a smart contract function call or a token transfer, requires a certain amount of gas to be executed.
	When a user sends a transaction to the Ethereum network, they must specify a gas limit and a gas price. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that the user is willing to spend on the transaction, and the gas price is the amount of ether that the user is willing to pay for each unit of gas.
When a miner processes a transaction, they will calculate the total cost of the transaction by multiplying the gas limit by the gas price. If the total cost is greater than or equal to the amount of ether that the user included in the transaction, then the miner will execute the transaction and include it in the next block that they mine.
	The use of gas on the Ethereum network helps to prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks, as attackers would need to spend a large amount of ether in order to overwhelm the network with transactions. It also ensures that users who want their transactions to be processed quickly will have to pay a higher gas price, which incentivizes miners to prioritize their transactions.

Bridging Technology 

	Crypto bridging technology refers to the use of a cryptocurrency "bridge" to connect two different blockchain networks and enable the transfer of tokens between them. This technology allows users to take advantage of the unique features and benefits of different blockchains without having to sacrifice the assets they have built up on one network.
	Typically, a crypto bridge is a type of smart contract that runs on one blockchain and is designed to interact with another blockchain. When a user wants to transfer a token from one blockchain to the other, they can do so using the bridge contract, which will automatically create a corresponding token on the other blockchain. This allows users to seamlessly move their assets between different blockchain networks without having to go through a centralized exchange.
	Crypto bridging technology has the potential to greatly improve the interoperability of different blockchain networks and make it easier for users to take advantage of the unique features and benefits of each network. It could also help to facilitate the development of new and innovative decentralized applications that can run on multiple blockchain networks. 

Decentralized Oracle Network

	Although bridging is the most widely adopted method for interoperability, bridging between crypto networks presents an attack vector as there have been several protocols compromised through various exploits. 
Crypto oracles offer a decentralized solution to value but at a cost. Crypto oracles are pieces of software that allow smart contracts on the blockchain to access external information from the real world. These smart contracts are often used to execute complex financial transactions automatically, but they are unable to access data outside of the blockchain. That's where crypto oracles come in.
	In general, an oracle is a person or thing that provides wise and insightful advice or prophetic predictions. In ancient Greek religion and mythology, an oracle was a priest or priestess who acted as a medium through which the gods were believed to speak. Today, the term can also be used to refer to a person who is considered to be an expert in a particular field, or to a mechanism or device that is used to provide answers or solve problems. In the field of computer science, an oracle is a term used to refer to a black box that is capable of solving a problem that is not solvable by a computer program.
	Crypto oracles act as a bridge between the blockchain and the outside world by providing the smart contract with access to real-world data. This data can be anything from the current price of a stock to the weather in a certain location. The smart contract can then use this information to determine how to execute the transaction.
	Oracles are typically decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any single entity. This ensures that the data they provide is accurate and unbiased. In order to prevent tampering, crypto oracles often use a combination of on-chain and off-chain data sources, as well as various cryptographic techniques, to verify the authenticity of the data they provide.
	A decentralized oracle network is essential for enabling smart contracts to access and use real-world data, allowing them to execute complex transactions automatically and securely.	An problem with decentralized oracle networks is there is a fee associated with quirying information. Just like Bitcoin and Ethereum charge users transaction fees for sending value, oracle networks like Chainlink require a fee to verify the real world data is accurate. 

Centralized Finance
 
	An exchange can be hacked in a number of ways. One common method is for hackers to gain access to the exchange's network by using malicious software to exploit vulnerabilities in the exchange's security systems. Once they have gained access to the network, the hackers can then steal sensitive information such as user login credentials or confidential financial data. Another way that an exchange can be hacked is through the use of phishing scams, where hackers send fake emails or messages to users of the exchange, tricking them into giving away their login information or other sensitive data. Additionally, some exchanges have been hacked through insider attacks, where a malicious actor with access to the exchange's systems uses that access to steal funds or sensitive information.
	High-frequency trading (HFT) is a type of algorithmic trading that uses powerful computers to execute a large number of trades at extremely high speeds. The goal of HFT is to capitalize on small price movements in highly liquid stocks or other securities by executing a large number of trades in a very short period of time. This is typically done by using advanced algorithms and high-speed computer systems to analyze market conditions and identify trading opportunities. HFT firms often use complex algorithms and sophisticated computer systems to make decisions about when and what to trade, with the goal of executing a large number of trades in a very short period of time in order to maximize profits.
	Computers have made retail traders in the traditional financial system obsolete. The velocity of growth in AI and algorithms have extracted the majority of profits from an efficient market. 
	Moore's Law predicts  that the number of transistors on a microchip will double every 18-24 months, leading to a rapid increase in computing power and a decrease in the cost of computers. This prediction has largely held true over the past several decades, with the number of transistors on a microchip increasing exponentially and the cost of computing power decreasing accordingly. Moore's Law has been a driving force behind the rapid pace of technological innovation and the development of new and more powerful computing technologies and has been proven accurate. 


Decentralized Finance 

	Decentralized finance or Defi, is the future of value transfer. DeFi is a financial system that is based on blockchain technology and smart contracts. In a decentralized finance system, financial services are provided without the need for a central authority or intermediary, such as a bank. This means that users can access financial services directly, without having to go through a traditional financial institution. Decentralized data sources are less susceptible to single points of failure. Decentralized finance has the potential to increase access to financial services and make them more affordable, transparent, and secure.
Automated market makers are algorithms that are designed to automatically provide liquidity to a market by automatically buying and selling assets. These algorithms use a mathematical formula to determine the prices at which they will buy and sell assets, and they can be designed to provide liquidity to a variety of different markets, such as stock markets, cryptocurrency exchanges, and prediction markets. When a user wants to buy or sell an asset on the market, the automated market maker algorithm will automatically match the trade and provide liquidity to the market. This allows for efficient and seamless trading, as the algorithm can quickly and easily match buyers and sellers without the need for a traditional market maker.
	Crypto liquidity pools are a way to improve the liquidity of a cryptocurrency by allowing users to deposit their tokens into a pool. The pool then combines the tokens from all the users and makes them available to be traded on exchanges. This can help to reduce volatility and make it easier for users to buy and sell the cryptocurrency.

	
Interoperability 

	Interoperability refers  blockchain networks to communicate and exchange information with each other. This can be achieved in various ways, but one approach is to use a "bridge" that connects the different blockchain networks and allows them to share data and transactions. In the case of "bridgeless" interoperability, the different blockchain networks are able to communicate and exchange information without the need for a central entity.
	Interoperability is achieved by allowing assets to be swapped between networks and be used interchangeably. This can be achieved through the use of common standards and protocols, such as the use of the same encryption algorithms or the implementation of atomic swaps, which allow for the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another without the need for a third-party exchange. Another way to achieve interoperability is through the use of cross-chain bridges, which allow for the transfer of assets between different blockchain networks.
	An asset on one network can be represented on another by a process known a wrapping. WBTC, or Wrapped Bitcoin, for example, is a type of cryptocurrency that is based on the Bitcoin network. It is an ERC-20 token that is pegged to the value of Bitcoin, meaning that each WBTC token is worth the same as a certain amount of Bitcoin. This allows Bitcoin to be used on Ethereum-based platforms, where it can be traded, exchanged, and used to pay for various goods and services.
	An atomic swap is a type of trade that allows two individuals to exchange cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without the need for a third-party intermediary. This can be done using smart contracts on a blockchain, allowing the trade to be carried out automatically and securely. The term "atomic" refers to the fact that the trade is either completed in its entirety, or it doesn't happen at all – there is no partial execution of the trade. This can provide a level of security and trust that is not always possible with traditional exchanges.

Name Service

	Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized system for resolving human-readable names to Ethereum addresses. It allows users to register and use domain names that are easy to remember, instead of having to use long, difficult-to-remember addresses.
Here's how it works:
    1. A user registers a name that they want to use with ENS. This name must be unique, and the user must pay a small fee in Ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network) to register it.
    2. Once the name is registered, the user can set the address (or addresses) that the name should resolve to. This can be the address of a smart contract, a cryptocurrency wallet, or any other Ethereum address.
    3. When someone wants to send a transaction to the user's address, they can simply use the user's ENS name instead of the long, difficult-to-remember address.
    4. The ENS system will automatically resolve the name to the correct address, and the transaction will be sent to the correct destination.
	In this way, ENS makes it easier for people to use Ethereum and interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It also helps to reduce the risk of users sending transactions to the wrong address, which can result in lost funds.
	Similar to ENS, Lokey network uses it’s own name service called Key Name Service or KNS. When a city coin is created on the Lokey network, the name of the city lives forever on the blockchain. Once a city is minted, meta data is awarded to the minter and stored on the Interplanetary File System or IPFS. 
	The IPFS is a distributed file system that allows users to access and share files across a decentralized network of computers. It works by breaking large files into smaller pieces and storing those pieces across the network, rather than on a central server. When a user wants to access a file, they can use IPFS to search for and retrieve the pieces of that file from the network. This allows for faster access to files, as well as increased security and resilience, since the files are distributed across many different computers rather than being stored in a single, central location.

Mining Nodes 

	Mining nodes are specialized devices which validate transactions for a fee. Bitcoin miners  for example are computers or specialized hardware that use their processing power to verify transactions on the Bitcoin network. When a new transaction is added to the Bitcoin blockchain, miners compete to be the first to verify the transaction by solving a complex mathematical problem. The first miner to solve the problem gets to add the verified block of transactions to the blockchain and receive a reward in the form of newly minted Bitcoin. This process of verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain is known as mining, and the computers and specialized hardware that perform this work are called miners.
	A hashing algorithm is a mathematical function that takes an input of arbitrary size and maps it to an output of a fixed size. The output is known as a "hash value," "message digest," or simply a "hash." The input can be of any type, such as a message or a file, and the output is usually represented as a string of characters. The main purpose of a hashing algorithm is to create a unique rA hashing algorithm is a mathematical function that takes an input of arbitrary size and maps it to an output of a fixed size. The output is known as a "hash value," "message digest," or simply a "hash." The input can be of any type, such as a message or a file, and the output is usually represented as a string of characters. The main purpose of a hashing algorithm is to create a unique representation of the input data that is fixed-size and can be used to identify the original data. This is useful for a variety of applications, such as data integrity checks, password storage, and indexing data in databases.
A good hashing algorithm should have the following properties:
1. It should be easy to compute the hash value for any given input.
2. It should be hard to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value (known as a "collision").
3. It should be hard to modify the input data without changing the hash value.
4. It should be infeasible to recreate the input data from its hash value.
	Examples of popular hashing algorithms include the MD5 algorithm, the SHA-1 algorithm, and the SHA-256 algorithm. These algorithms are widely used for data integrity checks and are often used to generate secure hashes for password storage.epresentation of the input data that is fixed-size and can be used to identify the original data. This is useful for a variety of applications, such as data integrity checks, password storage, and indexing data in databases.

	A hashing algorithm is a mathematical function that takes an input of any size and converts it into a fixed-size output, known as a "hash" or "hash value". The input can be any type of data, such as a file, message, or even a password. The output is typically a string of numbers and letters of a fixed length, and it is always the same size for a given input.
	The key characteristic of a hashing algorithm is that it is a one-way function, meaning that it is very easy to compute the hash value for any given input, but it is practically impossible to determine the original input by only knowing the hash value. This makes hashing algorithms useful for storing and verifying sensitive information, such as passwords, without actually storing the password itself.
	To create a hash, the input data is processed through the hashing algorithm, and the resulting hash value is stored. When someone wants to verify the input data, they simply run the same data through the same algorithm, and compare the resulting hash value to the stored value. If the two values match, then it is highly likely that the input data is correct. However, if the values do not match, then the input data is almost certainly incorrect.
	Hashing algorithms are designed to be fast and efficient, so that they can handle large amounts of data quickly. They are also designed to be collision-resistant, meaning that it is very difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value. This is important because if two inputs could produce the same hash value, then it would be possible to "trick" the system by presenting the same hash value for two different inputs, making it difficult to verify the authenticity of the input data.
	Long-range radio technology uses radio waves to transmit information over long distances. Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, which means they are waves of electric and magnetic energy that can travel through the air. Radio waves are typically generated by an antenna, which converts electric currents into radio waves and sends them out into the air. The waves then travel through the air at the speed of light until they reach the antenna of a receiver, where they are converted back into electric currents and used to recreate the original information.


	There are many different types of long-range radio technology, and the exact way that they work can vary depending on the specific type of technology. For example, some long-range radio technologies use low-frequency radio waves that can travel long distances over land or water, while others use high-frequency radio waves that can be used for short-range communication but are able to penetrate through solid objects. In general, however, all long-range radio technology works by using radio waves to transmit information over long distances.
	Lokey mining devices also called ‘Nodes’ use long range radio to communicate across the network. Long-range radio technology uses radio waves to transmit information over long distances.

The Lokey nodes generally communicate 5 to 10 miles depending on a number of factors including elevation and relative proximity to other nodes on the network.
